            <td>These are the oldest forms of AI systems that have extremely limited capability.
                 They emulate the human mind’s ability to respond to different kinds of stimuli. These machines do not have
                 memory-based functionality. This means such machines cannot use previously gained experiences
                 to inform their present actions, i.e., these machines do not have the ability to “learn.”
                 These machines could only be used for automatically responding to a limited set or
                 combination of inputs. They cannot be used to rely on memory to improve their operations
                 based on the same. A popular example of a reactive AI machine is

                 Limited memory machines are machines that, in addition to having the capabilities of purely
                 reactive machines, are also capable of learning from historical data to make decisions.
                  Nearly all existing applications that we know of come under this category of AI. All present-
                  day AI systems, such as those using deep learning, are trained by large volumes of training
                 data that they store in their memory to form a reference model for solving future problems.
                 For instance, an image recognition AI is trained using thousands of pictures and their labels
                  to teach it to name objects it scans. When an image is scanned by such an AI, it uses the
                 training images as references to understand the contents of the image presented to it, and
                 based on its “learning experience” it labels new images with increasing accuracy.
                 Almost all present-day AI applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving 
                 vehicles are all driven by limited memory AI.
            </td>
            <td>While the previous two types of AI have been and are found in abundance, the next two types
                 of AI exist, for now, either as a concept or a work in progress. Theory of mind AI is the
                 next level of AI systems that researchers are currently engaged in innovating. A theory of
                 mind level AI will be able to better understand the entities it is interacting with by
                 discerning their needs, emotions, beliefs, and thought processes. While

                 is already a budding industry and an area of interest for leading AI researchers, achieving
                 Theory of mind level of AI will require development in other branches of AI as well. This is
                 because to truly understand human needs, AI machines will have to perceive humans as
                 individuals whose minds can be shaped by multiple factors, essentially “understanding”
                  humans.
                </td>
            <td>This is the final stage of AI development which currently exists only hypothetically. Self-
                 aware AI, which, self explanatorily, is an AI that has evolved to be so akin to the human
                 brain that it has developed self-awareness. Creating this type of Ai, which is decades, if
                 not centuries away from materializing, is and will always be the ultimate objective of all AI
                 research. This type of AI will not only be able to understand and evoke emotions in those it 
                 interacts with, but also have emotions, needs, beliefs, and potentially desires of its own. 
                 And this is the type of AI that doomsayers of the technology are wary of. Although the development
                 of self-aware can potentially boost our progress as a civilization by leaps and bounds, it can also
                 potentially lead to catastrophe. This is because once self-aware, the AI would be capable of having
                 ideas like self-preservation which may directly or indirectly spell the end for humanity, as such an
                 entity could easily outmaneuver the intellect of any human being and plot elaborate schemes to take 
                 over humanity.
                 The alternate system of classification that is more generally used in tech parlance is the classification
                  of the technology into Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and 
                  Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).</td>
            <td>This type of artificial intelligence represents all the existing AI, including even the most complicated and
                 capable AI that has ever been created to date. Artificial narrow intelligence refers to AI systems that can 
                 only perform a specific task autonomously using human-like capabilities. These machines can do nothing more 
                 than what they are programmed to do, and thus have a very limited or narrow range of competencies. According
                 to the aforementioned system of classification, these systems correspond to all the reactive and limited memory AI.
                 Even the most complex AI that uses machine learning and deep learning to teach itself falls under ANI.
                </td>
            <td>
                 Artificial General Intelligence is the ability of an AI agent to learn, perceive, understand, and function completely
                 like a human being. These systems will be able to independently build multiple competencies and form connections and 
                 generalizations across domains, massively cutting down on time needed for training. This will make AI systems just as
                 capable as humans by replicating our multi-functional capabilities.</td>
            <td>
                 The development of Artificial Superintelligence will probably mark the pinnacle of AI research, as AGI will become by far
                 the most capable forms of intelligence on earth. ASI, in addition to replicating the multi-faceted intelligence of human 
                 beings, will be exceedingly better at everything they do because of overwhelmingly greater memory, faster data processing
                 and analysis, and decision-making capabilities. The development of AGI and ASI will lead to a scenario most popularly referred
                 to as the singularity. And while the potential of having such powerful machines at our disposal seems appealing, these machines
                 may also threaten our existence or at the very least, our way of life.
