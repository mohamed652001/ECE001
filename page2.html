                and its subsequent components have been known for quite along time now. they are being
                looked upon as tools and techniques to make this world a better place, And it's just
                not that you have to go to these fancy tech gadgets to be able to use them. you can 
                simply look around and Iam pretty much sure most of your tasks are made smooth by the use of artificial intelligence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Its importance lies in making our lives easier. These technologies are a great asset to 
                humans and therefore are programmed to reduce the human effort as much as possible.
                 They tend to possess the capability of working in an automated fashion and therefore
                 manual intervention is the least thing which could be asked for or seen while operating
                 parts associated with this technology.
            </li>
            <li>
                These machines tend to speed up your tasks and processes along with a guaranteed level
                 of precision and accuracy and therefore this is what makes them a useful and important
                 tool. Apart from making the world an error-free place by their simple and everyday
                  techniques, these technologies and applications are not only related to our general and everyday lives. It is also impacting and holds importance for other domains as well.

                <h3>Top 4 uses of Artificial Intelligence</h3>

            The importance uses of artificial intelligence:
        </p>
        <h4>1. In the field of medical sciences</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The artificial intelligence has made a phenomenal impact in the medical industry and therefore
                 changes the face of the medical industry. There have been various machine learning algorithms
                 and models that have been working efficiently to predict various critical use cases such as 
                 determining whether a particular patient has malignant or benign cancer or tumor based on the
                  symptoms and the health records and history. It is also being used in future predictions where
                 the patients are being told well in advance about their deteriorating health and the preventions
                 which they should take to get back to a normal and healthy life.
            </li>
            <li>
                Artificial intelligence has been creating a virtual care private assistant which is specifically
                 built for people’s needs and is widely used for monitoring researching different types of cases
                 and for analysis over the past cases and their outcomes. It also seeks to improve their models 
                 and assistant’s efficiency by predicting what could be improved and thereby making themselves
                 smarter.
            </li>
            <li>
                The use of healthcare bots is another efficient move taken by the medical industry to work their
                 way up in the field of medicine which is known to provide 24/7 assistance and take up the less
                  important work of managing appointments. This has not been possible without the intervention
                   of these smart artificial intelligence-based machines.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>2.In the field of Air transport </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                 One of the major systematic transport in the world is air transport and there became an urgent 
                 need to optimize the way they are operated. Here came the involvement of artificial intelligence
                 where the machine is involved in planning the routes, along with flight landing and take-off
                 charts.
            </li>
            <li>
             The navigation maps and taxing routes, along with a quick check of the entire cockpit panel to
             ensure the correct working of every component has been performed with the 
             <a href="httpshref://www.educba.com/hill-climbing-in-artificial-intelligence/">Use of artificial intelligence</a>
             in many aircraft. This has been delivering very promising results and therefore is being adopted
              very frequently. The ultimate aim of artificial intelligence in the field of air transport is to
               give humans ease and a more comfortable journey.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
            3. In the field of Banking and Financial Institutions
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                the 
                <a href="https://www.educba.com/agents-in-artificial-intelligence/">artificial intlligence</a>
                 has been playing a significant role in managing financial transactions and also to handle
                 numerous other activities in the bank. The day to day tasks of the banks such as transactional
                 and financial operations, stock market money and their management, etc. are being worked upon by
                 these machine learning models in a much more easier and efficient way.
            </li>
            <li>
                 Use cases such as those of Anti-money laundering where the suspicious financial transactions
                 are being monitored and are reported to the regulators is a classic example of the use of 
                 <a href="https://www.educba.com/artificial-intelligence-ethics/">artificial intelligence</a>
                 in the field of banking and financial industry. Other use cases include those like credit
                 systems analysis which are popular among credit card companies where the suspicious credit card
                 transactions are tracked on the geographic level and based on various parameters is worked upon
                  and resolved.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>4. In the Field of Gaming and Entertainment</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
             From virtual reality games to the modern games which are there today, this is one industry where
             artificial intelligence has taken the biggest leap. The bots are always present to play with you
             and therefore you are not required to have a second person to play.
            </li>
            <li>
             The level of personal details and the graphics are also possible due to the advent of artificial
             intelligence and is taking this industry on a different level.
            </li>
        </ul>
