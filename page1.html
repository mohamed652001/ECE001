             In the first half of the 20
             <sup>th</sup>
             century,science friction familiarized the world with the concept of the artificially inelligent roboots.
             it began with the concept of the "heartless" tin man from the 
             <em>wizard of oz</em>
             and continued with the humanoid robot that impersonated maria in 
             <em>metropolis</em>
             .by the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, and philosophers
             with the concept of the artificial intelligence (or AI) culturally assimilated in their minds.
             one such person was Alan turing, a young british polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial intelligence.
             turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems and make decisions,
             so why can't machines do the same thing ? this was the logical framework of his 1950 paper,
             <a href="https:www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf">
            computing machinery and intelligence</a>
            in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their
            intelligence
